# Deferred work

Ordinary follow-ups live here; promoted whole-codebase review findings
belong in [review/BACKLOG.md](review/BACKLOG.md). Follow
[docket/TODO_GUIDE.md](docket/TODO_GUIDE.md). Ready entries are unblocked;
understood work awaiting a dependency or external input belongs in Waiting.
The user authorized staged implementation of the product redesign on
2026-11-01 after the disposable mechanism proofs, including parallel
work and reviewable pull requests while away. Production server package
and lifecycle changes remain outside that authorization. Completion is
measured against the first-release contract and acceptance scenarios.

- [DESIGN] `refine-later-server-milestones` — **Define concrete scenarios for the later milestones.** Extend accountability, replacement-host recreation, and reusable application knowledge without weakening the first release.
  - Source: [later milestones](plans/2026-10-31-server-environment-milestones.md#later-milestones), 2026-10-31.
  - Clarify dependencies and evidence, then split into bounded planning tasks before implementation. Recreation needs an identified Arch baseline and explicit external data and secret prerequisites.

- [DOCKER] `assess-codeman-lifecycle-stretch` — **Determine Codeman's actual lifecycle requirements from deployment evidence.** Its source/build layout may expose useful later work, but is not the first Docker benchmark.
  - Source: [stretch case](plans/2026-10-31-server-environment-milestones.md#later-milestones), user's Codeman correction, 2026-10-31.
  - Distinguish already-accountable resources from any unsupported checkout, build, or installer orchestration. Keep extensions outside milestone 1; do not turn the tool into a generic build framework.

- [TOOLING] `update-docket-finding-marker-validation` — **Resync Docket after its finding-marker validation handles early pipe closure correctly.** Valid claims must not fail strict validation while their backlog entry appears in both base and head.
  - Source: [vendored marker validator](docket/scripts/check-pr-markers.sh), reproduction during `review/resolve-installed-dependency-targets`, 2026-11-01.
  - Blocked by: an upstream Docket correction for the base/head entry producer piped to an early-exiting grep under pipefail; integrate the correction through the installer rather than editing vendored files.
  - Reproduction: with the claimed entry and its Findings present in both snapshots, the consumer finds the finding and exits successfully, but the producer receives SIGPIPE (`141 0` pipeline statuses), so valid Claims review finding markers are reported as absent. A draining consumer returns `0 0` on the same input.
  - Verify strict Claims and Resolves cases, retain rejection of absent findings, and preserve the original Claims input and reproduction evidence. This work does not authorize a gate or hooks-policy change.

- [DOCKER] `bind-compose-running-evidence-to-service-scope` — **Bind derived Compose running facts to their collected service scope.** Physical project identity alone does not establish that a previously observed running value applies to changed declared services.
  - Source: [Compose running observation](mpkg_manager/observe_compose.py), [planner fact binding](mpkg_manager/planning.py), independent real-store/parser reproduction during combined observation review, 2026-11-02.
  - Reproduction: collect one running app container for declared services=[app], then record services=[worker] for the same project. Reusing the original wire batch reports running agreement; collecting the identical Docker inventory against the new declaration correctly reports unknown because the declared service scope is unresolved. Reports remain non-executable.
  - Carry immutable bounded service-scope context through the observation/report boundary and require an exact applicable scope before comparing derived running facts. Missing legacy context and changed scopes must remain unknown. Preserve ordinary host/engine/project, freshness, privacy and unsupported-replica/one-off safeguards; no real Docker operations are needed for regression coverage.
